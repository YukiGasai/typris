    "And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand.",
    "Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.",
    "And he said unto them, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.",
    "If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.",
    "For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.",
    "Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding.",
    "And they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts.",
    "And Jesus went with him; and much people followed him, and thronged him.",
